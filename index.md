## ✨ Purpose

This repository provides a complete, organized documentation framework for directing, training, and sustaining church stage productions — especially large seasonal pageants such as Easter or Christmas.
It unites artistic best practices, technical operations, and spiritual formation under one clear standard.

**Primary Goals**

- Empower volunteers and leaders with clear expectations and language.
- Preserve ministry knowledge for future productions.
- Support AI/automation (via the Model Context Protocol, or MCP) for quick reference and training.
- Keep all creative work centered on **Christ, community, and excellence**.

> “Let all things be done decently and in order.”
> — _1 Corinthians 14:40_

Teach and model the heart of service through `/docs/06_ministry/servant-leadership.md` and `/docs/06_ministry/purpose.md`.
