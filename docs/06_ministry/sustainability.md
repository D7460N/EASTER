# Ministry Sustainability

## Why It Matters
Creative ministry thrives on consistency, not exhaustion.
Healthy teams reflect the rhythm of God's creation — work and rest.

## Core Practices
- **Rotate Roles** - Schedule breaks between productions.
- **Set Boundaries** - Limit weekly rehearsal hours to maintain family and faith balance.
- **Encourage Rest** - After major events, hold a Sabbath week with no rehearsals.
- **Share the Load** - Train backups; avoid “indispensable” roles.

## Cultural Markers
A sustainable ministry values presence over perfection and people over performance.

> “Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while.” — *Mark 6:31*
