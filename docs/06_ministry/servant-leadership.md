# Servant Leadership

## What It Means
Servant leadership puts others before self and seeks God's glory above recognition.
In a stage context, that means using your gifts to elevate the team and honor the message.

## Core Practices
- Serve first, lead second.
- Encourage others' success as much as your own.
- Be teachable and willing to take correction.
- Pray regularly for those you serve alongside.

## Application
Whether you hold a microphone, manage lighting, or move props, do it as worship.

> “Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.”
